# Wildcard Project

You have a cool idea for an algorithms project? Use this repository. Make sure
to explain what problem you're solving, how you're doing it, and that you test
your code.

# Task:
Applying algorithms to improve my previous Discrete Math project which was originally centered around Passes and Interceptions to help tell the story of a soccer/football match.

# Instructions to Directly Run Code (Dependencies)
### **Dependencies** - Anaconda Navigator: https://www.anaconda.com/download
In Anaconda Navigator, run Jupyter Notebook 6.5.4
In Jupyter Notebook, click the 'Upload' button at the top right and upload the following files found in this GitHub repository:
- CHELSEA.png
- LUTON.png
- Soccer Pitch.png
- Chelsea vs Luton Town Gathered Data.xlsx
- Chelsea vs Luton Town Wildcard Project Code - Algorithms.ipynb

Once uploaded, click on the "Chelsea vs Luton Town Wildcard Project Code - Algorithms.ipynb" file which should appear with a book icon now, then click run on each individual cell or click the 'Cell' tab and click on the 'Run All' option.

I used Python because it has built in libraries with some algorithms already available. Moreover, graphing is much easier in Python.
