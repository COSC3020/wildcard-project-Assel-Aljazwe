# Wildcard Project

You have a cool idea for an algorithms project? Use this repository. Make sure
to explain what problem you're solving, how you're doing it, and that you test
your code.

# Task:
Applying algorithms to improve my previous Discrete Math project which was originally centered around Passes and Interceptions to help tell the story of a soccer/football match.

# Instructions to Run Code (Dependencies)
I used Python because it has built in libraries with some algorithms already available. Moreover, graphing is much easier in Python.


# Output



# Analysis/Reasoning
